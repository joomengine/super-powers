If an identity cannot\r\nbe resolved according to the active execution context, execution is aborted\r\nimmediately with a runtime exception.\r\n\r\nThis trait is intended for use in privileged services, compilers, and\r\ncommand handlers where deterministic ACL behaviour is required across\r\nboth web and CLI environments.\r\n\r\n@since 5.1.4",
